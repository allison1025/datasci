    "### Important notes:\n",
    "1) Grading for this assignment is largely done by manual inspection. The autograder checks the basic details but is imperfect. Sometimes it will pass the test but not look right, sometimes it will look right and fail the test. That's fine! You should guide your answer by the look of our examples. It doesn't need to be pixel perfect (e.g., you may not always know what our example is scaled by), but it should be pretty close.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) When turning in your PDF, please use the File -> Print -> Save as PDF option ***from your browser***. Do ***not*** use the File->Download as->PDF option. Complete instructions for this are under Resources in the Coursera page for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Pay attention to the return types of your functions. "

Compared to the figure from the article, mine shows a bar chart comparing the number of tests each movie passes, which is ordered by descending order. If I were to do this for all of the 50 movies, it would have looked lengthier and have results displayed less concisely than the original figure. Therefore, the original visualization is more effective, as it gets the main point of which movie scored the best for the different tests overall in a much more organized way. "
