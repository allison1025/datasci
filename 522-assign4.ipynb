The images of Muhammad Ali and the boxing gloves next to the text \"ALI\" are distracting from the chart containing the actual data values, which has text that is too small and difficult for viewers to quickly grasp what the main takeaways of the data findings are. Additionally, the chart design could be improved, since having the labels oriented in various directions make it hard to read what each label is. By omitting the unnecessary images and then using that extra empty space to enlargen the data visualization, this would help to make it easier for readers to process the information from the chart. \n"

    "*IMPORTANT BROWSER ISSUE*: For some non-ES6 Browsers there are problems with date/time conversions (see [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html)). If things aren't working try something like Chrome for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "For the nearly 15,000 people in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, and the millions more huddled around TVs across the world, the Floyd Mayweather–Conor McGregor fight was a roller coaster of emotions. They were anxious as pay-per-view [technical problems](http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20469815/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-delay-ppv-problems) pushed back the fight’s start. They were full of anticipation when the combatants finally emerged after months of hype. They were surprised when McGregor held his own, or seemed to hold his own, for a couple of rounds. They were thrilled when Mayweather finally started fighting. And they were exhausted by the end.\n",

    "To the surprise of many (of the neutral and pro-Mayweather viewers, anyway) McGregor won the first round. The next couple were washes, and a quarter of the way into the [scheduled 12 rounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/sports/mayweather-mcgregor.html) … the Irish underdog may have been winning! The Irish flags and shamrocks followed on Twitter. Things slowly (perhaps even 😴ly) turned around as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in history took control of the man making his pro debut — an outcome which was predicted by precisely everyone.

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end.

Compared to the original visualization, this chart makes it easier to compare which emoji was the most widely used since the point for that emoji clearly stands out from the rest of the other emojis, which all have similar usage percents. However, since the rest of the emojis have similar percent values, and are not displayed in a descending rank order like how the bar chart visualization did, this makes it more challenging to compare how popular the rest of the emojis are."
